# Phone → desktop voice memo pipeline

No phone app needed. Record a thought on your phone, and it becomes searchable memory on your desktop. Claude even surfaces recent memos proactively — "you had a voice memo about pricing yesterday."

The watcher is folder-agnostic — it processes any audio file that lands in a watched folder. Pick the sync method that matches your setup:

| Phone | Desktop | Sync method |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **iPhone** | **Mac** | iCloud Drive (built-in, ~5-30s) |
| **iPhone** | **Windows/Linux** | iCloud for Windows, or Dropbox/Google Drive |
| **Android** | **Any** | Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncthing, or any folder sync |
| **Any** | **Any** | AirDrop, USB, email — drop the file in the watched folder |

### Setup (one-time)

**Step 1: Create a sync folder** — pick one that syncs between your phone and desktop:

```bash
# macOS + iPhone (iCloud Drive)
mkdir -p ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/minutes-inbox

# Any platform (Dropbox)
mkdir -p ~/Dropbox/minutes-inbox

# Any platform (Google Drive)
mkdir -p ~/Google\ Drive/minutes-inbox

# Or just use the default inbox (manually drop files into it)
# ~/.minutes/inbox/  ← already exists
```

**Step 2: Add the sync folder to your watch config** in your config file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/minutes/config.toml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, otherwise `~/.config/minutes/config.toml`):

```toml
[watch]
paths = [
  "~/.minutes/inbox",
  # Add your sync folder here — uncomment one:
  # "~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/minutes-inbox",  # iCloud
  # "~/Dropbox/minutes-inbox",                                       # Dropbox
  # "~/Google Drive/minutes-inbox",                                  # Google Drive
]
```

**Step 3: Set up your phone**

<details>
<summary><strong>iPhone (Apple Shortcuts)</strong></summary>

1. Open the **Shortcuts** app on your iPhone
2. Tap **+** → Add Action → search **"Save File"**
3. Set destination to `iCloud Drive/minutes-inbox/` (or your Dropbox/Google Drive folder)
4. Turn OFF "Ask Where to Save"
5. Tap the **(i)** info button → enable **Share Sheet** → set to accept **Audio**
6. Name it **"Save to Minutes"**

Now: Voice Memos → Share → **Save to Minutes** → done.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Android</strong></summary>

Use any voice recorder app + your cloud sync of choice:

- **Dropbox**: Record with any app → Share → Save to Dropbox → `minutes-inbox/`
- **Google Drive**: Record → Share → Save to Drive → `minutes-inbox/`
- **Syncthing** (no cloud): Set up a Syncthing share between phone and desktop pointing at your watched folder. Fully local, no cloud.
- **Tasker/Automate** (power users): Auto-move new recordings from your recorder app to the sync folder.
</details>

<summary><strong>Manual (any phone)</strong></summary>

No sync setup needed — just get the audio file to your desktop's watched folder:
- **AirDrop** (Apple): Share → AirDrop to Mac → move to `~/.minutes/inbox/`
- **Email**: Email the recording to yourself → save attachment to watched folder
- **USB**: Transfer directly
</details>

**Step 4: Start the watcher** (or install as a background service):

```bash
minutes watch                  # Run in foreground
minutes service install        # Install all background services (macOS launchd / Linux systemd)
minutes service status         # Check what's running
minutes service restart        # Restart all services (e.g. after upgrading the binary)
```

`minutes service install` sets up three agents:

| Agent | Schedule | What it does |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **watcher** | Always on | Processes voice memos from `~/.minutes/inbox/` |
| **weekly-summary** | Sundays 7pm | Generates a weekly digest to `~/.minutes/automations/` |
| **proactive-context** | Daily 8am | Builds a context bundle from recent meetings, memos, and live stale commitments |

> **Upgrading?** `minutes service install` is idempotent. Re-running it after a binary
> upgrade rewrites all plists/units and reloads with the new binary path.

### How it works

```
Phone (any)                   Desktop (any)
───────────                   ─────────────
Record voice memo        →    Cloud sync / manual transfer
Share to sync folder               │
                                   ▼
                            minutes watch detects file
                                   │
                            probe duration (<2 min?)
                              ├── yes → memo pipeline (fast, no diarization)
                              └── no  → meeting pipeline (full)
                                   │
                            transcribe → save markdown
                                   │
                            ├── event: VoiceMemoProcessed
                            ├── daily note backlink
                            └── surfaces in next Claude session
```

Short voice memos (<2 minutes) automatically route through the fast memo pipeline — no diarization, no heavy summarization. Long recordings get the full meeting treatment. The threshold is configurable: `dictation_threshold_secs = 120` in `[watch]`.

### Optional: sidecar metadata

If your phone workflow also saves a `.json` file alongside the audio (same name, `.json` extension), Minutes reads it for enriched metadata:

```json
{"device": "iPhone", "source": "voice-memos", "captured_at": "2026-03-24T08:41:00-07:00"}
```

This adds `device` and `captured_at` to the meeting's frontmatter. Works with any automation tool (Apple Shortcuts, Tasker, etc.).

Supports `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.webm`. WAV is decoded in process. Compressed formats are decoded inside a bounded child process, using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) when it is installed and a bundled decoder otherwise. The bundled decoder covers AAC, MP3, Vorbis and FLAC; ffmpeg is required for Opus, which is what `.webm` browser recordings and `.ogg` voice notes normally contain, and for ALAC in `.m4a`.

If a desktop call capture leaves a raw file under `~/.minutes/native-captures/`, process that audio file directly with `minutes process <path> --type meeting`. For compatibility, `minutes import <audio-file>` also routes to the same meeting-processing path; `minutes import granola` remains the Granola history importer.

### Vault sync (Obsidian / Logseq)

```bash
minutes vault setup              # Auto-detect vaults, configure sync
minutes vault status             # Check health
minutes vault sync               # Copy existing meetings to vault
```

Three strategies: **symlink** (zero-copy), **copy** (works with iCloud/Obsidian Sync), **direct** (write to vault). `minutes vault setup` detects your vault and recommends the right strategy automatically.
