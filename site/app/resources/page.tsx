 * This hub exists because the resource pages had no route in from the rest of
 * the site. Until 2026-09-02 the homepage, /compare, /docs, and the shared

 * non-branded search impressions were reachable only from each other. Keep the
 * list complete: a page missing here is a page with one fewer link in.
