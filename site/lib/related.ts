/** Curated cross-links between resource pages.
 *
 * The resource pages were written independently and never linked to each other.
 * Six of the eighteen had no inbound link from anywhere on the site, so a reader
 * who landed on one had no route to the rest and no way to discover that the
 * neighbouring question was already answered.
 *
 * Relations are hand-written rather than derived from tags. A generated
 * "related" list produces plausible-looking but useless pairings, and the note
 * on each entry only means something if a person wrote it about that specific
 * pair. Three or four entries per page is deliberate: a longer list is a link
 * dump, and readers ignore it.
