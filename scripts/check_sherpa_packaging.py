"""Assert the sherpa archive still packages a working engine.

`Release CLI Binaries` runs only on tags and workflow_dispatch, so nothing on a
pull request builds the sherpa archive. A change that stops it shipping a
usable engine therefore stays invisible until someone cuts a release.

That is not hypothetical. #685 moved sherpa into a dlopened cdylib outside the
workspace, which meant `-p minutes-cli --features engine-sherpa` stopped
emitting any sherpa shared library. The archive step still copied `*.so` out of
the CLI's target directory, matched nothing, and would have failed the next
tagged release. Every pull-request gate was green throughout.

An earlier version of this guard matched substrings against a slice of the raw
file. Adversarial review showed it accepted a workflow that deleted the copy,
pointed at the old target directory, commented out the plugin build while
leaving the words in the comment, or verified the build-tree plugin instead of
the packaged one. It also rejected correct alternatives such as
`--manifest-path` and `[[ -f ... ]]`. So this parses the workflow, strips
comments before matching, and keys on the step id rather than its name.
